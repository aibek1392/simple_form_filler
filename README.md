1. **JobApplicationExtractor** - Extracts all required fields from job application forms
2. **JobApplicationFiller** - Fills out forms with realistic dummy profile data

## Features

```python
from job_application_tools import JobApplicationExtractor, JobApplicationFiller

results = filler.fill_application_form(fields, url)
# Manual review required here - DO NOT SUBMIT
filler.close()
```

### Custom Dummy Profile

You can modify the `_generate_dummy_profile()` method in `JobApplicationFiller` to customize the dummy data used for form filling.
